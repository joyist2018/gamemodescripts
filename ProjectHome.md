SourceMod plugin that executes various scripts based upon gamemode and difficulty settings.

Current features include:
Automatic config file execution based upon mp\_gamemode and z\_difficulty. If the file doesn't exist, nothing happens (current server settings persist). If there is a mode\_difficulty file and a mode only file, the mode\_difficulty file will be used.

Forced gamemodes and difficulties by cvar settings. Prevents certain gamemodes from playing on a server. Also good for forcing 1 type into a specific mode (eg: a Versus lobby into Realism Versus).

Map voting with menus generated by a maplist which includes valid gamemodes for each map. Players and/or Admins can call votes at any time, but primarily this is for changing maps at the end of the game.
